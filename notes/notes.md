# ideas

## for creativity
* compute the importance metrics of the nodes used in milestone 1
* compupte correlation between different importance metrics
* find communities relevant to the policy, find policy for those communities 
* other idea: link the important variable with the cycle analysis. For example, try to find cycles that contains several of the most important variables. This cycle would be interesting to discuss by itself.
* then we can also find the cycles in which at least 2 of our variables in milestone 1 policy appear. this can be used to "inform" policy changes

## other
* say in limitations that the network structure is just a proxy for policy impact, and that we loose a lot of information by converting to a network
